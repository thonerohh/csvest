# csvest
CSV for harvesting purposes over internet

I am interested in using files over root directory databases, so wondering to make accomplish fast usega of this theory with buttons, initiable apps or just files with icons and names that can be initiated in directory. e.g. 

1. "split csvs" for optimization of the file weights
2. "categorize csvs" to sort files other the folders or duplicate data to other folders
3. "update datafolder" so order the files not in the header of each unique database file as usual, other make a .SET file for example and grub settings of the entire folder from there

Idea was pushed me forvard after dozen customers striving to rearrange their .xlsx file to the proper format, over 7 hours of my life I was spant only for changing format and over 40-120 hours in a year I was spent to argue about the format of providing data for the Accessible Over The Web Directory of the resource.
